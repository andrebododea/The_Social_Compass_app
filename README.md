# The_Social_Compass_app
An app that allows you to see your direction (compass) and also allows you to capture and share photos through social media, while also tagging them with your photo's location and direction so others photographers can find the same spot in the future.

For screenshots of the app as well as some more detailed explanation of the implementation check out the [report PDF](https://github.com/andrebododea/The_Social_Compass_app/blob/master/Embedded_Systems_Assignment_1.pdf)
